Things always seem to come full circle. When I had my interview for Launch Academy one of the more unusual questions they asked me was about IKEA. They wanted me to walk them through the process of buying something, bringing it home and putting it together. I thought I answered the question OK, but as is often the case you think of a thing or two later that you may have left out. In my case I didn't really go into much detail about actually assembling anything. Who knew that assembling something from IKEA would be a necessary skill in my first post Launch Academy position.

That's my boss Adam assembling a drawer which was purchased from IKEA. That's our new office space in lovely downtown Natick. Day one for Barbershop Labs in our new spot. It really was an exciting day. Which is why it really didn't matter much when that drawer fell apart a few minutes later. It should be noted that Adam handled most of the assembly. I stuck to unpacking. My only insightful observation consisted of, "It's not usually a good thing if there are a bunch of screws left over."

I'm going to miss the mall. At least so far the music hasn't been as good, but in fairness the bar was set pretty high. All in all though I think the positives far outweigh the negatives. I have my own key. I don't have to worry about not having a place to sit when I get back from lunch or the bathroom. We have our own internet with solid upload and download speeds. No more mooching off the free wi-fi. Once Adam gets the beer fridge in place we'll be all set!

We didn't get much actual work done today, but that's beside the point. We'll make up for it tomorrow. As for the app. I think it's getting pretty close to MVP status. Now I actually have to get set up to record and produce custom highlights. The app will likely be good to go before I'm ready to actually voice anything. While 'You Make the Call' is getting closer I'm already thinking about another idea. I probably should finish this one first. No details to share yet, just a thought really, but maybe a more ambitious one at that.
