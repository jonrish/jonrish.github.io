<h2>A Quick Summary</h2>
<p>I am a web developer. I broadcasted Red Sox Baseball on the radio. I am also a husband and a father of four. </p>
<p>I spent nearly 20 years as a professional sports broadcaster. In April of 2013 I quit my job and enrolled in a ten week developer bootcamp called <a href="http://www.launchacademy.com" target="_blank">Launch Academy.</a> Now I am continuing to learn and build. </p>

<p>I grew up in southern New Jersey. I came to New England to attend Boston College and that's where I met my lovely wife Christina! My broadcasting career started at WZBC and ended with the Red Sox on WEEI. Among the many stops along the way: ESPN Radio and many wonderful seasons with BC Hockey.</p>

<p>Now I live in Natick, MA. I like to sleep and I like to drink beer. Not necessarily in that order. I suppose in that respect not much has changed since my days at BC. I also like to spend time with my kids. I like to go to Disney World, although I don't care much for the heat. I practically grew up on the beach, but I hate the sand. I can be picky about the music I listen too. Actually, I can be picky about a lot of things.</p>
