<h2>What is this blog for?</h2>
<p>Good Question! I'm not sure yet. I think it'll just be a place to for me to write things down. Sometimes what I'm working on or what I'm learning. Maybe some family stuff. We'll see.</p>
<h2>Why the hell would you quit a job as a Red Sox broadcaster?</h2>
<p>Ah the million dollar question. Short answer: I wasn't that happy doing it anymore and I determined that I was likely to become more unhappy as the years progressed. My career is just one facet of my life. It's time for something new.</p>
<h2>Ok then, why web development?</h2>
<p>I want to build things. I like to figure things out. I've always been very comfortable with technology. There are plenty of things I could be doing, but this is the only thing I came up with that comes close to how I felt about being a brodcaster 20 years ago.</p>
<h2>Do you miss broadcasting?</h2>
<p>Not that much believe it or not. I don't miss the job. I do miss my friends. I miss hanging around with Joe and Dave. I don't miss working nights and weekends, and I don't miss the travel.</p>
<h2>Why did you pick such a stupid title. I mean "The Rish Dish?", how dumb is that?</h2>
<p>I know. I'm not sure if it'll stick. Dave O'Brien came up with it. Among the many things I learned during my time in the booth - OB usually gets what he wants.</p>
